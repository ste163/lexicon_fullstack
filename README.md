## Developer setup
Instructions for setting up the backend and frontend for furthering Lexicon's development.

### Firebase
You will need to create a Firebase project to have working authentication and authorization.
- Go to [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and create a project (can be named anything)
- In the project settings, you will need your ```Project Id``` and ```Web API Key```

### Merriam-Webster
You will need to sign up for a free Merriam-Webster developer account to access the Thesaurus API. Ensure you select [Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Thesaurus](https://dictionaryapi.com/products/api-collegiate-thesaurus) as the API to use.

### Getting the Project
In the directory of your choice, from the terminal, run:
```git clone https://github.com/ste163/lexicon_fullstack.git```

### Backend
- In ```Lexicon\appsettings.json ``` change the ```"FirebaseProjectId": "lexicon-fullstack"``` to your projects ```Project Id```
- In ```Lexicon\SQL``` run ```01_Db_Create.sql``` then ```02_Seed_Data.sql``` to generate the database and starter data
- If you want access to the ```admin@email``` account created from the seed data, you will need to replace the generic data in the ```FirebaseUserId``` column with the Id generated from Firebase, which you can find on your project's page

### Frontend
- In ```Lexicon\client``` create a file called ```.env.local```
- Inside this file copy and paste: 

    ```
    REACT_APP_API_KEY=FirebaseAPIKey
    REACT_APP_MW_THESAURUS_API_KEY=MerriamWebsterAPIKey
    ```
- Replace the API keys with your unique keys
- Once the files are added run ```npm install``` to add all necessary files
- To start the development server run ```npm start``` from the client directory
